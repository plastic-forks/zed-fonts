## Version 1.2.2
- Symbols: `(`

## Version 1.2.1
- Symbols: `(`, `%`

## Version 1.2.0

- Breaking change: We new include the condensed versions of our fonts in the builds ("Normal"), and the normal width ("Extended"). Not confusing at all, right?

- Updated build plans – Removed specified variants for now to generate all variants


## Version 1.1.0

- Updated build plans – Mono and Sans now build with the same characters, weights and widths
- New characters:
  - Alphas: `N`, `W`, `X`, `g`, `x`, `y`
  - Numerics: `0`, `4`, `5`, `7`, `8`, `9`
  - Symbols: `*`, `_`, `(`, `{`, `&`, `%`, `|`, `?`

Characters were chosen to be scanable (`6` & `9` are more differentiated for example.) Some changes are subjective (`(` for example), and may be updated or walked back in the future.

## Version 1.0.0

Initial version of Zed Mono built from Iosevka.
